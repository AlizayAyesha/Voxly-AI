That can mean the duration, style, mentorship approach, and much more is up for experimentation and iteration. For our program and all community initiatives, we are driven by our desire to achieve the best outcomes for our learning community — how we get there and who leads the way is something we want to shape together with you and the community. Hence, this is only the start of what we hope will be a long and collaborative journey for our community. \nFor now, if you have ideas on how we can support creators better, we'd like to have this conversation with you. Please share your ideas — as detailed or brief as you see fit.",
